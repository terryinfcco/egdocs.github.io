Unsure about what the hell I'm doing. I clearly don't want to put the time and effort into trying to learn true web development or even django or flask. I'm back to screwing around with the hugo blog called egdocs that I created about 2 month ago. The only stuff I've really stuck with are Static Site Generators - especially mkdocs, and tkinter and it's offshoots - customtkinter and ttkbootstrap.
